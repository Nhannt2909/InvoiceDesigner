1.2.1
New Features:
	- Implemented a new Trial Balance report that provides a summary of account balances, grouped by account code, name, and currency.
	- The report supports filtering by date range and company.
Improvements:
	- Date/Time Locale Dependency Removed:
	- Transmitted data is now converted to the ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`) for both JSON and query string parameters, ensuring correct processing across different locales.
	- Implemented a custom JSON converter (DateTimeConverter) to handle the format of date and time properties globally.
	- Fixed model binding issues related to date formats in query parameters.
Enhanced Date Handling:
	- Set `DateStart` to the beginning of the day (00:00:00) and `DateEnd` to the end of the day (23:59:59) in the service layer, regardless of the time provided in the request.
Performance Optimizations:
	- Implemented `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries.
	- Implemented in-memory caching for currency names (`_cachedCurrencyName`) to reduce database load.
Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed issues related to pattern matching with nullable `DateTime?` types.
	- Fixed potential `NullReferenceException` in `QueryStringExtensions`
	- Fixed incorrect calculation of pagination in the service layer
